# Wornpage Projects — WebMCP Challenge

A small, static edition of Wornpage Projects built for the 2026 WebMCP Challenge. People and browser agents operate the same visible Priority, Work, Review, and Next screens; the agent receives a bounded projection of what the person can already see.

Live submission: <https://projects-webmcp-extension.pages.dev/webmcp-challenge>

The submission URL is publicly accessible without an account. Deployment-specific preview URLs remain separate from this production judge path.

The deployment is intentionally static. It has no sign-in, payment flow, Worker Function, database, secret, or production API. Sample changes stay in this browser.

## Where this edition came from

Projects was not invented during the challenge. A private predecessor records
the earlier, human-operated workflow and broad application history. During the
submission period, that foundation was extended in this separate, sanitized
public repository with page-scoped WebMCP tools, a bounded five-route judge
experience, lifecycle and fallback contracts, and an independently buildable
static artifact.

The predecessor and current production application remain private because their
broader history and application logic are outside the submission boundary.
Neither is needed to build, run, or verify this submission. The exact boundary
between prior work and challenge-period work is recorded in
[SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md](SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md), alongside the dated commit history.

## Why WebMCP fits

Ordinary browser automation has to infer meaning from layout and scrape a page that was designed for people. This demo lets each page publish a small, explicit tool catalog instead:

| Page | Tool | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guide | `get_projects_handoff_guide` | Read the visible guide, editable brief, discovered Work scopes, selected query, and exact workspace denominator |
| Priority | `get_next_recommendation` | Read the one visible actionable recommendation as its id, title, destination, and reason; no navigation, fetch, or write |
| Work | `get_current_work_view` | Read the bounded, filtered list, its denominators, and the visible Decision Workspace recommendation |
| Work | `show_work_search` | Change only the visible search scope |
| Work | `create_work_drafts` | Atomically add 1–3 browser-local items in Draft status; cannot start, block, complete, or delete them |
| Review | `get_current_review_queue` | Read the bounded queue, denominators, and visible reasons each item surfaced |
| Review | `set_review_scope` | Change only the visible review filter and query |
| Next | `get_current_next_editor` | Read the visible next-action editor and its validated Decision Workspace context when present |
| Next | `prepare_next_action` | Prepare an unsaved choice from 1–3 exact Work or Review facts; stale or mismatched facts are rejected and the page generates the visible evidence note |

The page owns registration and teardown through `document.modelContext.registerTool`. Every successful presentation-changing or draft-creation invocation leaves a polite, screen-reader-announced receipt naming the tool and its exact effect. Read receipts remain visually silent; search, scope, and Next preparation state that nothing was saved; `create_work_drafts` truthfully reports the browser-local workspace count change and Draft status. On Next, the agent submits exact `workId` / `field` / `expectedValue` references already observed on Work or Review. The page requires a current-item fact, checks every value against the live workspace, and deterministically generates the displayed evidence note; arbitrary agent prose cannot enter that field. Starting work and final saves remain visible, human-owned controls.

Decision Workspace navigation carries only the exact work id and a bounded context-mode marker into Next. The marker is not treated as provenance: Next independently verifies that the same loaded item remains an explicit open decision, then explains only current-state rules and the current decision owner. The route does not serialize recommendation prose or workspace facts, create a draft, or add another storage path; a person must still choose an action and approve the existing Save control.

On the Guide, **All visible work** is selected immediately with the full workspace denominator. Compact alternatives are derived from the current workspace's area fields and counted through the same shared text search used by Work; no sample family name is embedded in the chooser logic. **Custom** reveals the bounded query input only when a person wants another visible term or an honest zero-match result. The safe default brief forbids workspace changes; **Use fast-create brief** is an explicit human choice that authorizes only the existing three-Draft creation path and still forbids Start, Save, block, completion, and deletion. The collapsed browser status distinguishes an exposed reader API from registration success. The reader returns those exact live DOM choices, selection, counts, query, and editable brief, but has no navigation, persistence, server, telemetry, or decision authority. When the API is unavailable, Copy brief and the three ordinary route buttons remain usable.

## WebMCP implementation

The challenge documentation's `search_products` descriptor illustrates the imperative API shape. Wornpage Projects registers project-specific tools instead. A minimal direct registration of the Guide reader has that same shape:

```js
const registrationController = new AbortController();

document.modelContext.registerTool({
	name: 'get_projects_handoff_guide',
	description: 'Read the current Projects handoff guide and editable browser-agent brief rendered on this page.',
	inputSchema: {
		type: 'object',
		properties: {},
		additionalProperties: false
	},
	annotations: {
		readOnlyHint: true,
		openWorldHint: false,
		untrustedContentHint: true
	},
	execute: async () => readRenderedWebMcpChallengeGuide(document)
}, {
	signal: registrationController.signal
});
```

The shipped implementation adds exact-input rejection, validated current-page projections, truthful annotations, and complete descriptors in each route. Priority derives one actionable recommendation from the same browser-local workspace used by the visible page; its read-only tool returns only the rendered id, title, destination, and reason. Work's human-owned Quick Add and `create_work_drafts` both reuse the canonical create normalization. The tool performs one atomic transaction, adds at most three Draft-status items, and cannot Start or complete them. The Guide projection normalizes line endings, accepts an empty brief, permits only normal text plus tabs and newlines, and limits the brief to 1,000 characters. Its scope catalog is bounded to 24 derived choices and exposes shown, discovered, omitted, visible, matching, and workspace counts without hiding denominator changes. `workQuery` remains the deterministic Work-search mapping: All maps to empty, a derived choice maps to its displayed area text, and Custom maps to the bounded input. It trims boundary whitespace, accepts empty for all visible work, rejects control characters, and is limited to 120 characters. Duplicate, negative, inconsistent, or selected-choice-mismatched DOM projections are rejected. [`registerPageTools`](svelte-frontend/src/lib/webmcp.mjs) performs registration with one abort signal for the page-owned catalog; navigation removes the page tools together and any registration failure aborts the catalog. Toast producers only append messages through `displayToast`. The immutable WornToast component owns automatic timing and interaction pauses, and the layout removes a toast only after that component emits its dismissal event; Projects has no competing timer, capped eviction path, or route-specific producer.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 24.18.0 (pinned in `.node-version`).

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm --prefix svelte-frontend ci --ignore-scripts
npm run verify
npm --prefix svelte-frontend run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite, then visit `/webmcp-challenge` in a compatible browser for WebMCP tool discovery. The Guide reports whether the reader API is exposed without treating that as registration proof. If it is unavailable, the ordinary page remains usable with browser-local sample data.

`npm run build` creates the complete static deployment in `dist/static-publish`. That directory can be uploaded directly to Cloudflare Pages; no Pages Functions or Worker are required.

For a Cloudflare Pages Git deployment, use:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Build command | `npm run build:pages` |
| Build output directory | `dist/static-publish` |
| Node version | Read from `.node-version` (`24.18.0`) |

The Pages build script performs the nested locked frontend install before building, so it does not depend on a pre-existing `node_modules` directory.

## Reviewer path

1. Open `/webmcp-challenge`. Keep the selected **All visible work** default, or choose one of the displayed counted scopes. No workspace taxonomy knowledge or editing is required.
2. In a compatible browser, ask the browser agent: `Follow the brief on this page.`
3. Verify the Guide result includes the exact current `agentBrief`, `workQuery`, selected scope, matching count, and workspace denominator, and that no workspace data changed.
4. Optional: choose **Custom** to enter another visible term or a deliberately absent term. A no-match query must stay at zero on Work.
5. If the reader API is unavailable, use Copy brief; a nonempty Work scope is included with the brief. Continue through the three visible route buttons instead.

## Repository boundary

This is a fresh, challenge-only public extraction—not the production repository or its history. It contains five Svelte routes, deterministic sample data, their required shared UI, route-owned WebMCP descriptors, focused contracts, and a static build. Production authentication, billing, storage, private content, MCP servers, Worker code, deployment credentials, and unrelated routes are absent.

See [SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md](SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md) for the required pre-existing-versus-new-work record and [docs/submission/webmcp/public-repository-boundary.md](docs/submission/webmcp/public-repository-boundary.md) for the exact publication policy.

| Directory | Why it is present |
| --- | --- |
| `svelte-frontend/src/routes/` | Guide, Priority, Work, Review, Next, their WebMCP descriptors, and the shared 404 shell |
| `svelte-frontend/src/lib/` | Browser-local state, visible work-item rules, and only the UI pieces those routes import |
| `assets/` and `data/` | Challenge styling, landing media, and synthetic sample work |
| `tests/` and `scripts/` | Focused WebMCP contracts and the reproducible static build |
| `docs/` and root policy files | Eligibility evidence, public boundary, security policy, licensing, and reviewer instructions |

There is no `server/`, `worker/`, Pages Functions, or hidden compatibility route in the source tree.

## Verification

```sh
npm run verify
```

The gate runs Svelte diagnostics, focused WebMCP contracts, static-artifact contracts, and a production prerender. Current expected denominators are 103/103 public source paths, 99/99 WebMCP contracts, and 7/7 static-artifact contracts. A static contract derives those values from the current manifest and test sources so this reviewer-facing summary cannot silently drift. Manual WebMCP checks are listed in [docs/submission/webmcp/reviewer-tests.md](docs/submission/webmcp/reviewer-tests.md).
